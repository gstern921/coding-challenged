# SumFibs

This challenge can be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56662e268c0797cece0000bb)

Create a function that takes an argument n and sums even Fibonacci numbers up to n's index in the Fibonacci sequence.

Example:
```
sumFibs(5) === 2 // (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5); 2 is the only even number in the sequence and doesn't have another number in the sequence to get added to in the indexed Fibonacci sequence.
```
Example:
```
sumFibs(9) === 44; // (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34)
// 2 + 8 + 34 = 44;
```
